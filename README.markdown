# With one click, import a conversation from Twitter to Replyz
Click the extension icon while on a Twitter status page, and that status will be imported into [Replyz](http://replyz.com). A new tab will open to the imported conversation. Written in 45 minutes on 2/26/2012. Replyz had to be modified to not require the CSRF token, as well as return json when requested.

### TODO
* change the icon when on an importable page
* build various sized icons
* package and distribute in Chrome store
